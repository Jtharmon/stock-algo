# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Algorithm

This project is a pipeline-based machine learning system that streams stock market data, cleans and processes it, and trains a model to predict the direction of future stock prices. It is built with Python and uses `yfinance`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 **Data Streaming:** Fetches live or historical stock data using the `yfinance` API.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning:** Parses raw CSV data, handles missing values, and engineers features like returns and volatility.
- 🧠 **ML Model Training:** Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict whether the stock price will go up or down.
- 📊 **Evaluation Reports:** Provides precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy metrics on model performance.
- 📁 **Modular Structure:** Organized using a scalable, production-ready file architecture.
